# Hey there!
Welcome to my personal website! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in public Administration and policy at [Florida State University](https://coss.fsu.edu/askew/). My research focuses on digital governance, citizen engagement, performance management, and social equity from a behavioral perspective. I am particularly interested in topics like social media, AI, education, policing, and coproduction.
