# Hey there!
Welcome to my personal website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in public Administration and policy at [Florida State University](https://coss.fsu.edu/askew/). My research centers on citizen-state interaction from the perspectives of information, technology, and institutions, with a particular focus on policy implementation and evaluation, as well as social equity. I am particularly interested in topics like social media, AI, education, policing, and coproduction.
