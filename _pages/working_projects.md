### **Gaozhao, D.**, Wright, J. E., & Robinson, M. K., Do algorithms know all? Citizens’ perceptions of employing artificial intelligence in government decisions. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353169009_Do_algorithms_know_all_Civilians'_perception_of_employing_artificial_intelligence_in_government_decisions" target="_blank"><u>[Preprint]</u></a>

> Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in public service delivery. This presents several questions still left unknown about how citizens view the use of AI. In particular, are their perceptions of decisions made by AI different from those made by humans? This paper begins to answer this question by conducting a conjoint experiment to investigate citizens’ preferences and evaluations of decisions made by bureaucrats and by AI. Our results show that individuals generally prefer a racially minoritized government agent with a longer training history to deliver public services, over AI decisions. This is particularly true for racially minoritized citizens who care about representation. However, when representation within the bureaucracy is not possible, racially minoritized individuals do not have a clear-cut preference between AI and out-group bureaucrats. Our findings provide insight into the interaction between automation, representation, and equity in the delivery of public services.

### Wright, J. E., **Gaozhao, D.**, Dukes, K., & Templeton, D. P., The power of protest on policing: Black Lives Matter protest and civilians evaluation of the police. (Invited to revise and resubmit in _Public Administration Review_)

> In 2020, police brutality against Black Americans catalyzed BLM protests across all 50 states. Though BLM protests continue to permeate society, few scholars explore how these protests change Americans’ perceptions of the police. To investigate this phenomenon more meticulously, we administered an online survey experiment—oversampling Black American participants—to measure how protest culture, specifically BLM protests, influence civilians’ perceptions of the police. Our survey found that 1) Black American participants have a lower evaluation of police performance, but a higher evaluation of the BLM Movement than White American participants; 2) the presence of a general protest negatively impacts peoples’ perception of safety, police trustworthiness, and police performance; and 3) a BLM protest casts a stronger effect on White American participants than on Black American participants. Using Critical Race Theory (CRT) these findings suggest that the visibility of BLM protest changes both Black and White perceptions of the police at varying degrees.

### Wright, J. E., Gaozhao, D., & Houston, B., Body-Worn Cameras and Representation: What matters when evaluating police use of force?

> Public administration scholarship seeks to understand how representation can be a tool in increasing accountability within the policing profession. Recently, the introduction of body-worn cameras (BWCs) has added another layer to this accountability enigma. We employ an online conjoint experiment to disentangle the effects of both representation and BWC on police accountability and legitimacy. In the experiment, we ask participants to rate the likelihood that a police use of force incident prompts an investigation when there is a BWC present and representation (both gender and racial) matches between the officer and the civilian in the use of force incident. From our analysis, we find that Caucasian officers who use force are more likely to be investigated. Our findings also reveal that civilians believe male officers who use force should be investigated and there is no need for further police investigation when a BWC is utilized during a use of force situation. The implications of this study show that civilians view BWCs as the most important tool is providing accurate and honest assessment of police-civilian encounters, irrespective of the racial and gender makeup of the police and civilian during the encounter.
