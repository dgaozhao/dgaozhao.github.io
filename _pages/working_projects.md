Citizens’ perceptions of employing artificial intelligence in government decisions. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353169009_Do_algorithms_know_all_Civilians'_perception_of_employing_artificial_intelligence_in_government_decisions" target="_blank"><u>[Preprint]</u></a>

> Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in public service delivery. This presents several questions still left unknown about how citizens view the use of AI. In particular, are their perceptions of decisions made by AI different from those made by humans? This paper begins to answer this question by conducting a conjoint experiment to investigate citizens’ preferences and evaluations of decisions made by bureaucrats and by AI. Our results show that individuals generally prefer a racially minoritized government agent with a longer training history to deliver public services, over AI decisions. This is particularly true for racially minoritized citizens who care about representation. However, when representation within the bureaucracy is not possible, racially minoritized individuals do not have a clear-cut preference between AI and out-group bureaucrats. Our findings provide insight into the interaction between automation, representation, and equity in the delivery of public services.

> In 2020, police brutality against Black Americans catalyzed BLM protests across all 50 states. Though BLM protests continue to permeate society, few scholars explore how these protests change Americans’ perceptions of the police. To investigate this phenomenon more meticulously, we administered an online survey experiment—oversampling Black American participants—to measure how protest culture, specifically BLM protests, influence civilians’ perceptions of the police. Our survey found that 1) Black American participants have a lower evaluation of police performance, but a higher evaluation of the BLM Movement than White American participants; 2) the presence of a general protest negatively impacts peoples’ perception of safety, police trustworthiness, and police performance; and 3) a BLM protest casts a stronger effect on White American participants than on Black American participants. Using Critical Race Theory (CRT) these findings suggest that the visibility of BLM protest changes both Black and White perceptions of the police at varying degrees.
