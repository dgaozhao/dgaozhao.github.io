In 2020, police brutality against Black Americans catalyzed BLM protests across all 50 states. Though BLM protests continue to permeate society, few scholars explore how these protests change Americans’ perceptions of the police. To investigate this phenomenon more meticulously, we administered an online survey experiment—oversampling Black American participants—to measure how protest culture, specifically BLM protests, influence participants’ perceptions of the police. Our survey found that 1) Black American participants have a lower evaluation of police performance, but a higher evaluation of the BLM Movement than White American participants and 2) the presence of a general protest negatively impacts peoples’ perception of police performance. Using Critical Race Theory (CRT) these findings suggest that the visibility of BLM protest changes both Black and White perceptions of the police at varying degrees.

**Flagging fake news on social media: An experiment of media consumers’ identification of fake news**<br/>

Policymakers are taking action to protect their citizens and democratic systems from online misinformation. However, media consumers usually have a hard time differentiating misinformation from authentic information. There are two explanations for this difficulty, namely lazy reasoning and motivated reasoning. While lazy reasoning suggests that people may feel reluctant to conduct critical reasoning when consuming online information, the motivated reasoning theory points out that individuals are also thinking in alignment with their identities and established viewpoints. A proposed approach to address this issue is adding fact-checking flags in the hope that flags could alert people to information falsehoods and stimulate critical thinking. This study examines the impact of fact-checking flags on media consumers' identification of fake news. Conducting an experiment (n = 717) on Amazon Mechanical Turk, the study finds that experimental participants with different political backgrounds depend heavily on flag-checking results provided by flags. Flags are powerful to influence people's judgments in a way that participants have blind beliefs in flags even if the flag assessments are inaccurate. Furthermore, the study's results indicate that flag assessments made by professional fact-checkers or crowdsourcing are equally influential in shaping participants' identification. These observations provide public and private leaders with suggestions that fact-checking flags can significantly affect media consumers' identification of fake news. However, flags appear to have little ability to promote critical thinking in this experiment.

**Place plus race effects in bureaucratic discretionary power: An analysis of residential segregation and police stop decisions** (with James E. Wright II and Meagan A. Snow)<br/>
<small>_Public Performance & Management Review_, 2021, _44_(2), 352-377. [ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('segregation-abstract')">Abstract</a> | [Postprint][segregation-postprint] ]</small>

<div id="segregation-abstract" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
Discrepancies in bureaucrat behavior, residential segregation, and police stops that turn deadly have spurred critical analysis surrounding who gets stopped by the police and what happens once they get stopped. This study considers the effect of officers’ decision when performing vehicle stops and conducting vehicle or person searches, as measured at the block group level in Minneapolis neighborhoods. This research is one of the few empirical studies within public administration which examines police stop decisions during vehicle stops in segregated areas, and one of the few empirical studies that explores police actions toward immigrants. We find that majority African American areas of high segregation have 40% more vehicle or person searches than other parts of the city. Second, we find that in predominately African American areas with growing pockets of East African immigrant areas will be subject to 50% more vehicle and person searches. These results indicate that Black (whether native or foreign born) populations of people are more likely to have investigatory interactions with police officers.
