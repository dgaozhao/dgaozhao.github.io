I am a Ph.D. candidate in public administration and policy at [Florida State University](https://coss.fsu.edu/askew/).

My research centers on citizen-state interaction from the perspectives of information, technology, and institutions, with a particular focus on performance, policy implementation and evaluation, as well as social equity. My research covers topics like social media, fake news, artificial intelligence (AI), and coproduction. My work has appeared in _Government Information Quarterly_ and _Public Performance & Management Review_.

I received my B.A. in Journalism from [East China University of Political Science and Law](https://www.ecupl.edu.cn/) and M.P.A. from [Rutgers University - Newark](https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu/). I am an [APPAM Equity & Inclusion Fellow](https://www.appam.org/about-appam/awards/equity-inclusion-student-fellowship/2019/) and an [ASPA Founders' Fellow](https://www.aspanet.org/ASPA/About-ASPA/In-the-Community/Releases/2022-Fellows.aspx).
