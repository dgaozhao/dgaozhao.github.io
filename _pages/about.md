I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in public administration and policy at [Florida State University](https://coss.fsu.edu/askew/). 

My research focuses on digital governance, citizen engagement, performance management, and social equity from a behavioral perspective. I am particularly interested in topics like social media, AI, education, policing, and coproduction. My work has appeared in _Government Information Quarterly_ and _Public Performance & Management Review_.

I am an [ECUPL](https://www.ecupl.edu.cn/) and [Rutgers](https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu/) alumnus and a travel rewards junkie.
