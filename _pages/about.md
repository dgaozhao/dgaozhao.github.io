I am a Ph.D. candidate in public administration and policy at [Florida State University](https://coss.fsu.edu/askew/).

My primary research interests are in citizen-state interaction from the perspectives of information, technology, and institutions, with a focus on social equity. I have worked on topics like citizen perceptions, social media, fake news, algorithmic fairness, and coproduction. My work has been published or is forthcoming in _Government Information Quarterly_, _Public Administration Review_, and _Public Performance & Management Review_.

I received my B.A. in Journalism from [East China University of Political Science and Law](https://www.ecupl.edu.cn/) and M.P.A. from [Rutgers University - Newark](https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu/). I am an [APPAM Equity & Inclusion Fellow](https://www.appam.org/about-appam/awards/equity-inclusion-student-fellowship/2019/) and an [ASPA Founders' Fellow](https://www.aspanet.org/ASPA/About-ASPA/In-the-Community/Releases/2022-Fellows.aspx).
