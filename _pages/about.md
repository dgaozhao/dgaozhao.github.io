I am an assistant professor of public administration, public policy, criminal justice, and security studies at the [University of Dayton](https://udayton.edu/artssciences/academics/politicalscience/index.php).

My primary research interests are in citizen-government interaction from the perspectives of information, technology, institutions, and social equity. I have worked on topics including citizen perceptions, fake news, AI ethics, and coproduction. My work has been published or is forthcoming in _Government Information Quarterly_, _Public Administration Review_, and _Public Performance & Management Review_.

I received my Ph.D. in Public Administration from [Florida State University](https://coss.fsu.edu/askew/), M.P.A. from [Rutgers University](https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu/), and B.A. in Journalism from [East China University of Political Science and Law](https://www.ecupl.edu.cn/).
