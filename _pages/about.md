I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in public administration and policy at [Florida State University](https://coss.fsu.edu/askew/). I am also an [APPAM Equity & Inclusion Fellow](https://www.appam.org/about-appam/awards/equity-inclusion-student-fellowship/2019/).

My research primarily focuses on digital governance, citizen-state interaction, and policy implementation and evaluation, with a particular focus on performance management and social equity. My research covers topics like social media, fake news, artificial intelligence (AI), and coproduction. My work has appeared in _Government Information Quarterly_ and _Public Performance & Management Review_.

I received my B.A. in Journalism from [East China University of Political Science and Law](https://www.ecupl.edu.cn/) and M.P.A. from [Rutgers University - Newark](https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu/).
